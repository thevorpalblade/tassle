Things to evovle at each step:

phase
velocity
amplitude? maybe later



each step is:
base step + extra from proper motion


sigma + 

options:
generate effective coherence times
generate phase deltas
np.cumsum to get all phases


generate effective coherence times
generate velocity deltas
np.accumulate to do valley random walk


brainstorm: valley random walk width

Note, i did this, which probably is bad:
cd /usr/lib
sudo ln -s libwcs.so libwcs.so.5
Aaaand fixed it.
